# Amazon-Web-Scraper-Application-Product-Search
### Description
This Python script scrapes product information from Amazon.com, including the title, price, rating, reviews, availability, brand, number of cells, terminal type, manufacturer, and description. It utilizes BeautifulSoup for web scraping and requests for HTTP requests. The scraped data is then stored in a CSV file named "amazon_data.csv".

### Installation
#### Getting started with this scraper is easy:

### Clone or download the script to your local machine.
#### Install the required Python libraries:
- BeautifulSoup (pip install beautifulsoup4): A Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It provides easy-to-use methods for web scraping.
```pip install beautifulsoup4```
- Requests (pip install requests): A popular Python library for making HTTP requests. It allows you to send HTTP requests easily and handle responses.
```pip install requests```
- Pandas (pip install pandas): A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python. It provides data structures and functions to efficiently work with structured data.
```pip install pandas numpy```
- NumPy (pip install pandas): A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
```pip install pandas numpy```
- Run the script using Python: python amazon_scraper.py.

### Usage
#### Once you've scraped the data, here's how you can clean and visualize it:
- Cleaning Data:
-- Load the scraped data from the CSV file (amazon_data.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.
Handle missing values (if any) using Pandas functions like fillna() or dropna().
- Visualizing Data:
-- Use libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn to create visualizations such as histograms, bar plots, or scatter plots to explore patterns and relationships in the data.
For example, you could visualize the distribution of product prices, the relationship between ratings and reviews, or compare the availability of products across different brands.
